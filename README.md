### Analysis of Number of Births and Deaths :

* This data set ( _project.csv_ ) includes births and deaths of male and female in the years 2000-2012 quarterly. This data is based on sample registration system(SRS) which includes all births and deaths occurring in the country.

* This data is dynamic data, which allows for additions, deletions and/or modifications at any time, resulting in more accurate information in the database. The information provided here gives us to know about the population present in country for a required period.

* The analysis helps the government to know the number of births and deaths in the country. So from the above analysis the government can easily predict the number of births and deaths happening more or less in a quarter.
